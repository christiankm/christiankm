### Hello. ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christian Mitteldorf from Denmark, 31 years old, and based in Sydney, Australia now.

My passion is building great mobile apps for the Apple platforms, and have been doing so in Objective-C and Swift since 2013.

ðŸ”­ I am working from Sydney, currently employed by Bilue, creating apps and mobile solutions for some of the greatest businesses across Australia. I'm also co-organizer of Sydney CocoaHeads, and give talks at conferences and meetups. Reach out if you'd like to talk!

ðŸŒ± I'm the creator of [Stokki](https://stokki.app): an app for Apple-devices that helps you keep track of your stock portfolio and results.
Stokki is using my open-source Swift-package [FinanceKit](https://github.com/christiankm/FinanceKit), a framework with tons of models and calculations for working with money, stocks, investing and finance.
Additionally, I'm co-creator of [FI Scouts](https://fiscouts.com).

I am also running a personal finance and investing blog, and making e-books to teach people how to invest their own money like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, for fabulous results. I am an investor myself, and invest in stocks to reach a goal of becoming financially free and independent.
