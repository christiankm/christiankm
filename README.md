### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christian Mitteldorf from Denmark, 29 years old, and based in Sydney, Australia now.

My passion is building great mobile apps for the Apple platforms, and have been doing so in Objective-C and Swift for 7 years now.

ðŸ”­ I am working from Sydney, currently as a contractor. Reach out if you'd like to talk.

ðŸŒ± I'm the creator of [Stokki](https://stokki.app): an app for Apple-devices that help you keep track of your stock portfolio and results.
Stokki is using my open-source Swift-package [FinanceKit](https://github.com/christiankm/FinanceKit), a framework with tons of models and calculations for working with money, stocks, investing and finance.

ðŸ‘¯ I will move to Sydney, Australia when the circumstances allow it, and is therefore looking for a new full-time position in that area. Please reach out if you can be of help!

As a part-time project, I am also running a personal finance and investing blog, and making e-books to teach people how to invest their own money like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, for fabulous results. I am an investor myself, and invest in stocks to reach a goal of becoming financially free and independent.
