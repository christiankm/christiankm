### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christian Mitteldorf from Denmark, 28 years old.

My passion is building great mobile apps for the Apple platforms, and have been doing so in Objective-C and Swift for 7 years now.

ðŸ”­ Currently I am working as an iOS Engineer at [MobilePay](https://mobilepay.dk), which is one of the biggest apps in Denmark. It allows over 5 million users in Denmark and Finland to do mobile P2P payments, recurring payments, as well as single payments in shops, brick and online.

ðŸŒ± I'm the creator of [Stokki](https://stokki.app): an app for Apple-devices that help you keep track of your stock portfolio and results.
Stokki is using my open-source Swift-package [FinanceKit](https://github.com/christiankm/FinanceKit), a framework with tons of models and calculations for working with money, stocks, investing and finance.

ðŸ‘¯ I will move to Sydney, Australia when the circumstances allow it, and is therefore looking for a new full-time position in that area. Please reach out if you can be of help!

As a part-time project, I am also running a personal finance and investing blog, and making e-books to teach people how to invest their own money like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, for fabulous results. I am an investor myself, and invest in stocks to reach a goal of becoming financially free and independent.
